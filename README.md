# Inception LPC18XX Demos
This repository contains demos for the lpc1850 (but compatible with other lpc18xx boards).
Among these samples you can find interesting demos such as a light-http server, a systick-based tim counter in ms and much more.

# Use

A build script enables you to compile the expected demo by giving its directory name as argument.
For example, the http server is in the directory named 'Web' and can be built with the following command.
```
bash ./build.sh Web
```
